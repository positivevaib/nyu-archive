This directory contains the programs that, for various reasons, were not used as solutions to the class assignments and were therfore, not turned in.

- cnf_parser.py is the python implementation of a language parser for Assignment 1. This was completed before the work on the final CYK parser program that was turned in began. The reason for this program not being used was that while the program parsed the sentences as required, it did not follow the CYK parser algorithm and therfore, was neither very efficient, nor in line with the assignment guidelines.
